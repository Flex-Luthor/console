# Graphcool Dashboard

ðŸš€  Official source of [dashboard.graph.cool](https://dashboard.graph.cool/) written in Typescript 2 and based on React & Relay

## Changelog

### [Milestone M2](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/2)
* You can finally set values to `null` if they are not required by the field.
* Working with scalar list values is now a lot easier in the data browser.
* The number of models can grow pretty fast in a project which hides the rest of the side navigation. We now auto-collapse the list of models when you don't need them.
* We added a new way of authentication called "Permanent Auth Tokens" which is especially useful for server-side scripts. You can create and revoke tokens from our new project settings page. ðŸ”‘
* We simplified the process of adding a new model.
* Unsaved changes? We will prompt you to make sure you don't discard them accidentally.
* Instead of showing everybody the hash of password fields, we now hide it behind a rows of `*`s. (Double-click to reveal the hash. ðŸŽ©)
* *Fixed*: The dashboard now looks the same in Safari.

See **[here](CHANGELOG.md)** for a full list of all changes (features/bug fixes).

### IDE Setup (Webstorm)

We use a different version of TypeScript than the default Webstorm TypeScript compiler. That's why you have to do the following to get rid of all TypeScript errors.
Please run `npm install` before the setup.

1. Go to the `Preferences` _(macOS: "âŒ˜ + ,")_ window
2. In the left list menu **select** `Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript`
3. **Click** on the `Edit...` button in the `Common` Panel
4. **Select** `Custom directory`
5. **Browse** to your `project directory` and then **select** `node_modules/typescript/lib` and **click** `OK`
6. **Click** `OK` again in the `Configure TypeScript Compiler`
7. **Click** `OK` in the `Preference` window
