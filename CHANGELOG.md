# Recent Updates

We improve the Graphcool platform every day by releasing new features, squashing bugs, and delivering fresh documentation. Here's a list of what's recently happened.

## Work In Progress

## August 2016
### [Milestone M3](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/3)
* Our designer were hard at work to bring you the new and awesome Action UIüéä!
* There was a day when a huge list of permissions would break the UI in the structure view but that day is not today. üîÆ
* *Fixed*: During onboarding you would get stuck at "Add a Todo model". 
* *Fixed*: If you create a new model, it'll redirect you automatically to the model.

### [Milestone M2](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/2)
* You can finally set values to `null` if they are not required by the field.
* Working with scalar list values is now a lot easier in the data browser.
* The number of models can grow pretty fast in a project which hides the rest of the side navigation. We now auto-collapse the list of models when you don't need them.
* We added a new way of authentication called "Permanent Auth Tokens" which is especially useful for server-side scripts. You can create and revoke tokens from our new project settings page. üîë
* We simplified the process of adding a new model.
* Unsaved changes? We will prompt you to make sure you don't discard them accidentally.
* Instead of showing everybody the hash of password fields, we now hide it behind a rows of `*`s. (Double-click to reveal the hash. üé©)
* *Fixed*: The dashboard now looks the same in Safari.

### [Milestone M1](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/1)

* Managing relations between models was not as straightforward as it should be. This is a lot easier now with the new **Relations Page**. Give your data model some relation love ‚ù£Ô∏è.
* The colors of the dashboard looked a bit washed out over time, so we decided to repaint it. The paint still needs to dry... üñå
* You're now automatically redirected to a newly created project.
* Migration and default values now also work for lists.
* Something special happend to our codebase: Javascript evolved into **Typescript**. It was very effective against Bug-Type Pokemons. üî•
* *Fixed*: You can now edit list values in the Data Browser.
* *Fixed*: Sometimes deleted nodes remained visible in the Data Browser. Now you won't see them again. We promise.
* *Fixed*: We finally defeated the infinite loop monster which showed up after renaming a project.
