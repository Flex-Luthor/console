# Recent Updates

We improve the Graphcool platform every day by releasing new features, squashing bugs, and delivering fresh documentation. Here's a list of what's recently happened.

## Work In Progress

## August 2016

### [Milestone M2](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/2)
* You can finally set values to **null** if they are not required!
* Want to modify a list within the dashboard? Don't every write JSON ever again! We have a new popup for that!
* If you had 20 models you needed to scroll on the side bar to get to the actions. Now the models are in an expandable list with "swooooooosh" animations!
* We heard and we knew that the Project Settings Popup wasn't pretty. So we dedicated an entirely new page for the settings! You can even create and revoke system tokens from there. That'll enable you to control your Graphcool models, relations and actions manually! üîß
* Adding a new model doesn't give you an annoying popup. It's now all in a sleek and awesome inline design. (Yeah, we have an awesome designer üñå)
* Unsaved changes? no they won't be lost! We will prompt you to make sure you want to discard them.
* Instead of showing everybody the hash of password fields, we now hide it behind a rows of __*__s. Double-click to reveal the hash! üé©
* Checkout what you browser title displays when you're on the dashboard! We put an emoji in there, just to let you spot it between your 200000 tabs. #giveYourTabSomeLove
* *Fixed*: We talked with Safari and clearly communicated our definition of our relationship. Now we are on the same page everything should be rendered correctly.

### [Milestone M1](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/1)

* Managing relations between models was not as straightforward as it should be. This is a lot easier now with the new **Relations Page**. Give your data model some relation love ‚ù£Ô∏è.
* The colors of the dashboard looked a bit washed out over time, so we decided to repaint it. The paint still needs to dry... üñå
* You're now automatically redirected to a newly created project.
* Migration and default values now also work for lists.
* Something special happend to our codebase: Javascript evolved into **Typescript**. It was very effective against Bug-Type Pokemons. üî•
* *Fixed*: You can now edit list values in the Data Browser.
* *Fixed*: Sometimes deleted nodes remained visible in the Data Browser. Now you won't see them again. We promise.
* *Fixed*: We finally defeated the infinite loop monster which showed up after renaming a project.
