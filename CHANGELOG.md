We improve the Graphcool platform every day by releasing new features, squashing bugs, and delivering fresh documentation. Here's a list of what's recently happened.

## Work In Progress

## August 2016

### [Milestone M1](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/1)

* Managing relations between models was not as straightforward as it should be. This is a lot easier now with the new **Relations Page**. Give your data model some relation love ‚ù£Ô∏è.
* The colors of the dashboard looked a bit washed out over time, so we decided to repaint it. The paint still needs to dry... üñå
* You're now automatically redirected to a newly created project.
* Migration and default values now also work for lists.
* Something special happend to our codebase: Javascript evolved into **Typescript**. It was very effective against Bug-Type Pokemons. üî•
* *Fixed*: You can now edit list values in the Data Browser.
* *Fixed*: Sometimes deleted nodes remained visible in the Data Browser. Now you won't see them again. We promise.
* *Fixed*: We finally defeated the infinite loop monster which showed up after renaming a project.
